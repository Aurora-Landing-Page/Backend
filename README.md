# Steps to Run
- Make dotenv file:
  ```
  JWT_SECRET=<String>
  URI=<MongoDB Connection URI>
  NODE_ENV=<development | production>
  TZ=<IANA timezone identifier>
  SITE=<Site link>
  RAZORPAY_ID=<Razorpay account ID>
  RAZORPAY_SECRET=<Razorpay account secret>
  EMAIL=<Sender ID>
  EMAIL_PASSWORD=<Sender password>
  SMTP_SERVER=<SMTP Auth Server Address>
  ```
- npm install
- npm start

# API response format
## successResponses
- All `2xx` responses will be of the format:
  ```
  {
      title: <String containing the title corresponding to the HTTP status code>,
      message: <String containing success details>,
      ...fields    
  }
  ```
- The destructured object `...fields` contains additional fields as required by the specific response and is optional.

## errorResponses
- All `4xx` and `5xx` responses will be of the format:
  ```
  {
      title: <String containing the title corresponding to the HTTP status code>,
      name: <String containing name of the error>,
      message: <String containing error details>,
      stackTrace: <String which contains stack trace of the error>
  }
  ```
-  The field `stackTrace` is defined only if NODE_ENV environment variable is set to development.

## User Endpoints
   ### /registerUser
   - For registering new users.
   - Request must be encoded in the body as raw JSON in the following format:
     ```

   - Responds with:
     - `400` if the request is malformed / invalid
     - `500` if the user could not be created due to a server error
     - `201` with the user object in response JSON
